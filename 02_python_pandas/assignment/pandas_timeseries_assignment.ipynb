There are a million options in our python functions, and as you go you are just going to slowly learn about some. But the important lesson here is that if you want to do something (like skip a row) python probably has a way to do it. **Google is your friend.** If you google enough stuff, like \"skip row pandas read_csv\" which is basically just a description of what you wanted to do, I bet you will find some good info. There is also great documentation for all python functions. For pandas it's:  https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html .
