    "We’ve all been in the same boat - having multiple versions of a document that appear to be nearly identical. Maybe you have a paper or presentation that is geared towards a different audience or your advisor/committee is suggesting edits. Some software exists to allow us to track changes such as Microsoft Word’s Track Changes or Google Docs’ version history.\n",
    "\n",
    "These systems all start with a base version that eventually morphs into something similar or completely different. They allow you to “record” your progress in such a way that you can rewind and playback each change that has been made. Each of these changes are like ingredients to a recipe, you can remove or add any ingredient you like that ultimately results in a final product that may vary each time. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally these systems allow for multiple users to make independent changes to the document at the same time, and those changes can be incorporated into the same base document unless those users are editing the same section of the document which can cause a conflict.\n",
    "\n",
    "Utilizing a version control system enables a user to effectively track any and all changes and creates a different “version” of the file each time. These systems allow users to decide which changes will be made to the next version (this is called a commit), and capture the useful metadata about them. The full history of all changes (commits) and associated metadata for a project make up what’s called a repository, which can be kept in sync across multiple computers and operating systems allowing for a fluid collaboration.\n"

    "Now that we’ve seen how to create and track our own work. If a repository is public and you are not a collaborator, you can still use someone’s repository. This supports the notion of Open Science and making your work reproducible. Cloning is downloading a repository for your own use. If you do use someone else’s code, always be sure to cite them. If you found a bug in the repository you cloned, you can create an issue on the repository’s github repository by clicking the Issues button in the top task bar. If you have a suggestion that you think the maintainers should incorporate, you can create a pull request by navigating to the repository website and select pull request.\n",

Select the SSH button in the drop down and copy that link. Then in the terminal, navigate to where you want this folder to be, for example cd ~/Desktop.
