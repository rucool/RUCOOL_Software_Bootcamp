# Class 1

Welcome!

## who are we? (Travis, Alex, Julia)


## why are we teaching this course?
1. a course we wish we'd had at the start of grad school when learning to code
1. good to learn the basic coding skills, would have helped me, but often learned on the fly while doing other things
1. decouple the learning of these tools from all the other domain specific stuff you need to learn in grad school
1. give you a structure and time to practice (pressure to actually do it)

## Why python? 
1. big, active open source community. 
1. extensive array of cutting edge packages for all kinds of work (plotting, machine learning etc.)
1. realativly easy to 'read', easier to pick up than other languages
1. once learned helps organizing your thinking and improve your analysis
1. transferrable skills, used in many public and private companies and orgs
1. transferable because it is a general purpose programming language which can many things from web servers to complex numerical work (unlike matlab which fundamentally a tool for linear algebra)
1. downsides might be that your lab (particularly older PIs) might use Matlab and its easier in the short term to re-use legacy code 
1. for those used to excel: a little more effort learning something like python early will boost your productivity and sophistication of analysis later. makes manipulating data more efficent.

## Our group
* variety of experience and backgrounds. 
* I imagine different people will get different things from this class, 
* and we need to be open minded and flexible to accommodate learning goals for all. 
* will start with very basics, assuming no coding experience,
* will build to things that I'm sure will be new and useful to even experienced coders


## housekeeping: 
1. Zoom Auto-mute: hold spacebar to quickly chime in
1. Files will be distributed on Canvas and/or Github
1. announcements on canvas with tips and tricks
1. going to cover a lot of ground quickly. downside to this format is that you may not have as much time to let things sink in. To get the most out of the class, please review throughly before the start of class each day. Going to be hard to keep all this new info in your head.
1. expectations: mostly we will work together on main content, examples, and 'homework' in class in large or small groups. my main expecations are that each of you participate activly, and come to class prepared to make the best of the short time we have. 
1. at some point we will send a doodle pool to orgnaize a time for the hackhours in the fall, but for now focus on the core material 
1. a common problem with these types of workshops is different systems running code differently, and hard to de-bug technical issues. Hopefully everyone tested their systems with the instructions we sent out.
1. going to RECORD the different modules when I am leading the code workbooks. These will be available for you to listen back to, but not publicly available
1. lecture 'notes' (you will see) are available in interactive and static (PDF) formats so you can easily go back and reference
1. **internet problems!** at some point someone is going to have slow internet, hopefully its not me! If you find you are unable to follow because of slow internet, a backup option is to watch the recordings asynchonously (but not my first choice)
1. will try to have frequent short breaks, and one 'coffee' break during the 3 hour time slot (about 145)
1. basically everything will be interactive, with you co-coding along with me. I will type/code in real time, which will be slow, the idea being you can keep up along side
1. will try to have many small problems and assignments for you to work, will attempt to use breakout rooms for this  
1. **Questions**: I don't want to just monolog. We will have to feel out how Q and A works as a free for all. If needed I may do some cold-calling on people for answers. I think it's harder online for spontanous QA than in a classroom, but we still want to do it. will also use polls (test operating system poll?)
1. **ERROR MESSAGES** you will often try to run some code and get an error messsage. you will see this happen to me a lot. the most common problem is that you'd mis typed something. This is part of the learning process! always check for mis typing. You'll see I'm not a great typist, and I am horrible at spelling, but learning to debug is a skill
1. Volunteer TAs

#### apart together
We have a unique hybrid teaching enviornment. I would like to give this class a feel of in-person where we get to know eachother, and where you could lean to your neighbor to ask a question. We will see how that works. You can use the public chat and the private chat to direct questions, comments, at eachother or me! I will try to monitor it, maybe Sam and Jackie can also keep tabs. 

## everyone introduce themselves

* who you are, 
* maybe something like: coding experience? what you hope to get out of the course? type of research? Any littel bit of info
