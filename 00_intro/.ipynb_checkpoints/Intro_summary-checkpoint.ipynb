In python we load files from a location in the same way that you would in the shell. So it really helps to have an idea of how this works, and what it all represents. \n",

    "### Navigating Files and Directories\n",
    "\n",
    "Several commands are frequently used to create, inspect, rename, and delete files and directories.\n",
    "\n",
    "To find out your username in general, you can use the command\n",
    "\n",
    "`$ whoami`\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, let’s find out where we are by running a command called pwd (which stands for “print working directory”). At any moment, our current working directory is our current default directory, i.e., the directory that the computer assumes we want to run commands in unless we explicitly specify something else. \n",
    "\n",
    "` $ pwd`\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand where you are, let’s have a look at how the file system as a whole is organized. For the sake of this example, we’ll be illustrating the filesystem on a unix computer. After this illustration, you’ll be learning commands to explore your own filesystem, which will be constructed in a similar way, but not be exactly identical.\n",
    "\n",
    "On a Unix computer, the filesystem looks like something this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![](tree.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "At the top is the root directory that holds everything else. We refer to it using a slash character / on its own; this is the leading slash in /home/jovyan.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s learn the command that will let us see the contents of our own filesystem. We can see what’s in our home directory by running `ls`, which stands for “listing”:\n",
    "\n",
    "`$ ls`\n",
    "\n",
    "`ls` prints the names of the files and directories in the current directory in alphabetical order\n",
    "\n",
    "on a mac of unix system you can use `ls -F` to see more info about things. This probably won't work for those of you on a pc\n",
    "\n",
    "if something in the list is followed by a slash `/` that means its a directory, or folder, otherwise it's a file or perhaps a program\n",
    "\n",
    "The command to change locations is `cd` followed by a directory name to change our working directory. `cd` stands for “change directory”, which is a bit misleading: the command doesn’t change the directory, it changes the shell’s idea of what directory we are in.\n",
    "\n",
    "`$ `\n",
    "\n",
    "Are we all in our swbc directory?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say we want to move to a directory. we can say \n",
    "`$ cd whereever`\n",
    "\n",
    "and `pwd` and `ls` to see where we are and whats in there\n",
    "\n",
    "We now know how to go down the directory tree, but how do we go up?\n",
    "There is a shortcut in the shell to move up one directory level that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "`$ cd ..` \n",
    "\n",
    "We call the address of some file of directory the `path`, so when you type `pwd` the thing that gets spit out is the path. \n",
    "\n",
    "Actually, we call that thing the `absolute path` because it tells you where you are all the way from the root of the filesystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also can refer to a directory by a `relative path`, which is just the address relative to where we are now. \n",
    "\n",
    "For example `..` is a relative path, its the adress of the folder above me relative to where i am now\n",
    "\n",
    "In the schematic of the file system, pretend you are in the student directory and you want the absolute path, what command do you use? what would the absolute path look like?\n",
    "\n",
    "`pwd`\n",
    "\n",
    "`/users/student`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "if you were in the staff directory and you wanted the address of the student directory you could write out the absoulte path, but could also write a relative path, what would that be?\n",
    "\n",
    "`../student`\n",
    "\n",
    "what about the relative path from staff to steve?\n",
    "\n",
    "`../admin/steve`\n",
    "\n",
    "Why are we doing this? one basic reason is that I want to get you thinking about how a computer is structured so that we can write code that accesses data and files in different places around the computer\n",

    "Just a couple of useful commands for working with directories\n",
    "\n",
    "there is so much more you can do with the shell! but we are just going to use a few commands to navigate for now\n",
    "\n",
    "you can create a new directory at the command line using `mkdir` which sort of looks like make-DIRectory. Let's make a directory we'll use for the remainder of the class to work in python. Some tips, make this somewhere both easy to navigate from the terminal and a GUI window, and **avoid putting this in a cloud drive like google drive, box, dropbox, onedrive, or sharepoint, etc.** Sometimes if these drives dismount it can break things, avoid it for now and if you want to do that in the future test it and do some research to see what works best.\n",

    "### Good names for files and directories\n",
    "\n",
    "Complicated names of files and directories can make your life painful when working on the command line. Here we provide a few useful tips for the names of your files.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Don’t use whitespaces.\n",
    "\tWhitespaces can make a name more meaningful but since whitespace is used to break arguments on the command line is better to avoid them on name of files and directories. You can use - or _ instead of whitespace.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Don’t begin the name with - (dash).\n",
    "\tCommands treat names starting with - as options.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Stick with letters, numbers, . (period), - (dash) and _ (underscore).\n",
    "\tMany other characters have special meanings on the command line. We will learn about some of these during this lesson. There are special characters that can cause your command to not work as expected and can even result in data loss.\n",
