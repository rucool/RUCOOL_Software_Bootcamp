    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the data file (argo_float_4901412.npz ) using `numpy.load()` and save it to a variable called `data`. This loads the data as a `dictionary` (remember those?) where the `keys` are the name of a ARGO observation, and the `values` are the data for that variable\n",
    "\n",
    "1. use `list(data.keys())` to see the `key` labels for the data \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extract the temperature, pressure and salinity arrays to variables called T, S, P \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Extract the date, lat, lon, and level arrays. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Note the shapes of T, S and P compared to these (date, lat, lon, and level) arrays. How do they line up?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make a plot for the first column of data in T, S and P (three plots). The vertical scale should be the levels data.  Make sure you label the axes on each plot. Flip the veritcal axis direction so that levels increase downward on the plot using `plt.ylim([80, 0])`. change that to `plt.ylim([ 0, 80])` and note what happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The data consist of a series of temperature and salinity profiles. How many profiles are there? Make a plot of all of them using `plt.pcolormesh()`. Check out the documentation for pcolormesh: https://matplotlib.org/3.3.0/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.pcolormesh.html . use your date data for the x axis, levels for the y axis, and T or S to be the data that is represented in color. Add a `colorbar()`\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compute the mean of each of T, and S at each level. When you look at the `pcolormesh` image from the excercise above, you will see some white areas in the data. These are places with no, or bad data for some reason. They are filled with a data type called `NaN`, short for 'not-a-number'. `NaN` has a property that any math operation on it changes the output to `NaN`, for example 4+ `NaN` = `NaN`. When we take the mean in this excercise I want you to use a variation on `numpy.mean()` called `numpy.nanmean()` which still takes the average, but ignore `NaN` values in the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Now make two plots: show only the mean T and S at each depth. extra credit: Show error bars on each plot using the standard deviations. Again, make sure you label the axes and put a title on each plot.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a scatter plot of the positions of the ARGO float data. Color the positions by the date. Add a grid overlay using `plt.grid()`. check out the documentation for `scatter()`: https://matplotlib.org/3.3.0/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.scatter.html\n",
