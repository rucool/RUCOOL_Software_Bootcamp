    "In order to do something more useful, we are going to need to be able to access data. How do we load data into python? To load the test data we will work with, we need to access (`import` in Python terminology) a library of code (think of it as a toolbox) called `NumPy`.\n",

    "`NumPy` is a toolbox that is not part of the most basic part of python. It's a code library that lots and lots of people work on imporving. It forms the basis of almost all other scientific python tool boxes, so it's super important. \n",

    "To get `NumPy` (you only need to do this once):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. go to the little `+` on the left to open a `launcher` window. \n",
    "1. click the 'terminal' tile to open a terminal\n",
    "1. type `conda env list` and hit enter. Make sure that there is a `*` next to the line that says swbc\n",
    "1. if that's right type `conda install numpy`\n",
    "1. when it asks `proceed ([y]/n)?` type `y` and hit enter\n",
    "\n",
    "Great! You just used the anaconda manager to download and install this important python library! You only need to do this once to get `NumPy` on your computer. We will follow the same proceedure to get a lot of other code, but lets start with the `NumPy` tools.\n",

    "### importing `NumPy` into this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, one more critical step! before we can use the tools from numpy in this code notebook, we need to tell python we are going to use it. In python-speak we need to `import` the `NumPy` library. We will always have a step like this in our code where we gather all the tools we need for our work. We can import `NumPy` using:"
